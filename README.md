Attempting to write a POSIX-compliant `ls` in Rust that's faster and prettier than GNU's.

[exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa) and [lsd](https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd) are both great `ls`-like Rust programs, but they're slower than what they intend to replace. This project is a demonstration that we can make things better and faster at the same time.
